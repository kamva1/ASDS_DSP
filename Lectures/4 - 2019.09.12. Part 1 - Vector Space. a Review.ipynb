    "A ***vector space*** (also called a linear space) is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied (\"scaled\") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms. For specifying that the scalars are real or complex numbers, the terms ***real vector space*** and ***complex vector space*** are often used. ***Euclidean vectors*** are an example of a vector space. They represent physical quantities such as forces: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector spaces are the subject of linear algebra and are well characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a ***norm or inner product are more commonly used***, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of ***Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces***, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The second operation, called scalar multiplication $ \\cdot  : F x V \\to V$， takes any scalar $a$ and any vector $v$ and gives another vector $a \\cdot v$ (Similarly, the vector $a \\cdot v$ is an element of the set $V$.)\n",
