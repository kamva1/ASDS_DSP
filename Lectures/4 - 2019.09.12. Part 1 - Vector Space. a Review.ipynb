    "A ***vector space*** (also called a linear space) is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied (\"scaled\") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms. For specifying that the scalars are real or complex numbers, the terms ***real vector space*** and ***complex vector space*** are often used. ***Euclidean vectors*** are an example of a vector space. They represent physical quantities such as forces: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector spaces are the subject of linear algebra and are well characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a ***norm or inner product are more commonly used***, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of ***Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces***, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.\n",

    "***Every vector space has a basis***. This follows from ***Zorn's lemma***, an equivalent formulation of the Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases is equivalent to the axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality. It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory."

    "Once a basis of $V$ is chosen, linear maps $f : V \\to W$ are completely determined by specifying the ***images of the basis vectors***, because any element of $V$ is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them. If $dim V = dim W$, a 1-to-1 correspondence between fixed bases of $V$ and $W$ gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of $V$ to the corresponding basis element of $W$. It is an isomorphism, by its very definition. Therefore, two vector spaces are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa. Another way to express this is that any vector space is completely classified (up to isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any n-dimensional $F$-vector space $V$ is isomorphic to $F^n$. There is, however, no \"canonical\" or preferred isomorphism; actually an isomorphism $\\phi : F^n \\to V$ is equivalent to the choice of a basis of $V$, by mapping the standard basis of $F^n$ to $V$, via $\\phi$. The freedom of choosing a convenient basis is particularly useful in the infinite-dimensional context."
